## Publishing a site

To publish a Linton web site, run the following command:

```
/PATH/TO/BIN/linton publish /BASE_URL/ DOCUMENT_ROOT /PATH/TO/OUTPUT
```

Here, `BASE_URL` is the URL of the web site relative to the server,
`DOCUMENT_ROOT` is the path to the input directories, and the `OUTPUT` path
is where the files for your web server go.

For more information, run: `/PATH/TO/BIN/linton publish --help`.
