# Why Linton?

_Why is Linton a good thing?_

Linton is designed to make it straightforward to build web sites that will last a long time, unattended. Every element of Linton, from the Python code comprising the main tool, to the HTML and CSS in the default template, has been designed or chosen to be simple and durable.

Linton is flexible, but simple. It has a single HTML template to control the look of the site, with carefully-chosen defaults for fonts, sizes, colours and layout. The navigation bar displays a breadcrumb trail showing the location of the current page within the site, and a menu of related pages.

Linton web sites are designed to be relocatable: that is, they can be served from any location on a web server, or browsed offline as files in a file system.
