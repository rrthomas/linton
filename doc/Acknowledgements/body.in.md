Linton is derived from [DarkGlass](https://github.com/rrthomas/DarkGlass), which in turn is derived from my wiki, [Wiklet](https://rrt.sc3d.org/Software/Wiklet), whose early versions were based on [DolphinWiki](https://web.archive.org/web/20051025080507/http://www.object-arts.co.uk:80/wiki/html/Dolphin/FrontPage.htm), which in turn was derived from the original [WikiWikiWeb](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki). Alistair Turnbull gave invaluable criticism, as ever. Pat Boyde funded its development from DarkGlass, a “string and sealing-wax” personal project, into a robust and reusable program, as part of my work on his archival web sites of [semi-staged dramas](https://www.boydesclassicdramas.org) and art lectures (in preparation!).
