# Linton

Linton is a simple static web site builder that produces a web site from a collection of Markdown files and other resources. The overall look of the site is controlled by an HTML template and CSS stylesheet that can be edited by any text editor. Linton pages are written as Markdown.

Linton comes with a simple web server that you can use to test a site in development. As it produces entirely static web sites (just a collection of files), they should be easy to install on any web server.
